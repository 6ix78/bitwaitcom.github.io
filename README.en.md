##About spring cloud
Spring cloud is an ordered collection of frameworks.Taking advantage of the development convenience of spring boot, it cleverly simplifies the development of distributed system infrastructure, such as service discovery and registration, configuration center, message bus, load balancing, circuit breaker, data monitoring, etc., which can be started and deployed with one click with the development style of spring boot.Spring cloud does not repeatedly manufacture wheels. It just combines the relatively mature service frameworks developed by various companies and can stand the actual test. It is repackaged through the spring boot style, shielding the complex configuration and implementation principles. Finally, it leaves a set of simple, easy to understand, easy to deploy and easy to maintain distributed system development kit for developers.Generally speaking, a complete spring cloud framework should be as shown in the figure below:
![spring cloud framework diagram]![system architecture] (PIC /% E7% AE% 80% E4% BB% 8b. PNG)
If you are not familiar with spring cloud, you can simply learn the relevant tutorials of spring cloud first, so that it will be easier to get started when you come back to this project.
Remind me, because the spring cloud framework diagram is a complete architecture, we will appropriately cut some content during development to make development and deployment faster, so there are some differences.
##About matchmaking trading engine
The system uses memory matching for the transaction queue, uses Kafka to transmit the matching order information, mongodb to persist the order transaction details, and MYSQL to record the overall order transaction.
Including 01_Framework / exchange project is mainly responsible for memory matching, 01_The framework / market project is mainly responsible for order transaction persistence, market generation, market push and other services, including:
-  K-line data, with intervals of 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week and 1 month respectively
-  Market depth data of all trading pairs
-  Latest price of all transaction pairs
-  Recent transactions
**Mode supported by memory matching transaction**
-  Matching of limit order and limit order
-  Matching of market order and limit order
-  Matching of limit order and market order
-  Market order matching with market order
**Limit & market order processing logic**
![limit & market order processing logic]
(https://images.gitee.com/uploads/images/2020/0408/144633_457c0552_2182501.
png "2222.png")
Note: This diagram is from a long time ago, and the logic in the latest code is more complex
**Other functions supported by matchmaking engine**
In addition to setting the initial transaction volume and transaction price of btdt / USC, the matching engine can also set the initial matching time and transaction price of the transaction, so as to meet the matching mode of the transaction and the market price of the ordinary transaction.
**Examples**
The exchange is expected to launch trading against AAA / usdt at 12:00:00 on August 8, 2020. However, as a newly launched currency, how can we do without activity?The project party or the Exchange decided to take out 10000 AAA for rush purchase at the price of 0.0001usdt (market price: 0.0005).The system supports the setting of such activities.
In addition, if the project party or the exchange decides to issue 10000 AAA at the price of 0.0001 usdt, we don&apos;t want everyone to rush to buy, but hope that all users who recharge usdt can divide up 10000 AAA on average. The system also supports the setting of this activity.
**Summary**
In short, the system supports highly customized matching mode. At the same time, you can also develop your own matching transaction mode by modifying the matching logic in the exchange project.
##About technical composition
-  Back end: spring, spring MVC, spring data, spring cloud, spring boot
-  Database: MySQL, mongodb
-  Others: redis, Kafka, Alibaba cloud OSS, Tencent
-  Front end: Vue, iView, less
##Actual demo site
[https://www.bizzan.org](https://www.bizzan.org)
This is for the customer, but later the customer didn&apos;t operate, so I left this website. Because I don&apos;t have server permission, this website may not be accessible at any time.
To build a test site, I need to buy several ECS servers, which costs a lot, so I didn&apos;t build a test site myself, but the system is complete, which has been tested by business and actual operation for nearly a year.
>About trading robots
>The trading robot is an automatic trading program, which can automatically trade according to the external market, so that the trading price of the exchange is consistent with the external market, so as to prevent the loss caused by "brick moving" by some users.
>About moving bricks
>For example, the BTC price of exchange a is 10000usdt, while the BTC price of exchange B is 9500usdt. To move bricks is to buy BTC at the price of 9500usdt in exchange B, and then transfer it to exchange a to earn the price difference (500usdt).
  
>If there is no Trading Robot in the exchange, there will be a price difference between the currency price of the exchange and other mainstream exchanges, allowing users to "move bricks" and causing losses to the exchange.
>In addition, the trading robot has another function, which is to form an initial trading depth during the initial operation of the exchange, which will not make users feel that the exchange is deserted and there are no users.
I am a java programmer and don&apos;t know much about mobile terminal development, so I actually pay others to help with package debugging and installation.
If you don&apos;t have technicians, I can help you build a complete exchange system, but you need to hire one or two maintenance personnel, because the stable operation of the system requires operation and maintenance personnel.

##Technical support
This digital currency trading system is a project developed by our company for the exchange. The exchange has stopped operation due to team reasons, and our company has also been dissolved in February.When I participated in the project, I was responsible for the overall R & D management, architecture design and customer docking, so I mastered all the codes.
There are some places that need special attention in the function use of the system, such as the new transaction and other operations in the future. Improper operation will cause the error of data disorder.
I can provide paid technical assistance and training guidance!

##Precautions
When the memory is insufficient, enter top on the Linux console to see that Java processes occupy a lot of memory (one java process occupies more than 1G). Because there are many jar packages to run, it is necessary to control the memory used by some jar packages. You can choose several projects that do not consume much resources, as follows:
```
java -jar -Xms128m -Xmx128m -Xmn200m -Xss256k admin-api.jar
java -jar -Xms512m -Xmx512m -Xmn200m -Xss256k cloud.jar
java -jar -Xms512m -Xmx512m -Xmn200m -Xss256k wallet.jar
```
##About email & SMS
1.     The system supports the sending of e-mail and SMS, and the operation status of the system
2.     System notification / alarm support: 24 kinds of monitoring ## about database script, including user registration, user authentication, user recharge / withdrawal, currency RPC operation status, system resource usage monitoring, etc
Some friends reported that there is no complete SQL file, because the successfully compiled jar will automatically map the entity to the database structure after the first run. The SQL in the project only completes some database structures that cannot be completed by spring cloud.The database auto generation configuration is located in applicationProperties configuration file:
> #jpa 
> spring.jpa.show-sql=true 
> spring.data.jpa.repositories.enabled=true > spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update 
spring.jpa.hibernate.DDL auto = update this configuration will automatically update the database structure.

##About blockchain wallet docking
The project provides two wallet docking methods: one is self built node + blockchain browser, and the other is third-party wallet docking.If you want to use self built nodes or blockchain browsers, you can use 00 directly_The code in the framework can be compiled.If you want to use a third-party wallet docking, you can download 07_Uduncloud folder project files of Youdun wallet, copy them to 00_In the framework.
After you get the code, you may not connect the blockchain node during the debugging and operation of the project, which will not have a great impact;Even if the blockchain node is not connected, you can deploy a trading platform with matching trading function (only the user cannot recharge through the wallet address).
When you become familiar with the whole system and have a certain basic reserve of blockchain operation principle, node construction and blockchain browser, you can start * * 01_wallet_Research the items in the RPC * * folder.Each currency corresponds to different data access methods. The wallet operation methods of most blockchain projects are the same or very similar, such as BTC, LTC
The API operation modes of bitcoin derivatives such as BCH, BSV and BCD are almost the same;Another example is eth. When you master the operation of a contract currency, the operation methods of other digital currencies issued based on eth are almost the same.So basically, when you take the time to understand one, you understand a bunch of currencies.The wallet operation schemes used in this project are also different, and different usages are shown as far as possible:
-  For example, BTC and usdt use self built full nodes, which now require almost 300g of hard disk space;
-  For example, ETH uses self built light nodes ([reference article]
(https://www.cnblogs.com/bizzan/p/11341713.html））, because the whole node needs too much hard disk space;
-  For example, BCH and BSV use the third-party blockchain browser to obtain data;
-  For example, XRP has officially provided an interface for accessing block data ([ripple API GitHub address]
(https://github.com/ripple/ripple-lib/)）
Generally speaking, when the amount of funds in and out of the exchange is small, you can explore by yourself, but when the amount of funds in the exchange is large, if you are not confident about your wallet operation, you can also use the wallet service of a third party. Of course, this requires you to negotiate with the wallet service provider and pay an annual fee or something.
The following figure is a brief description of the user recharge monitoring logic. Just take a simple look:
